    <h1> Welcome to my digital nomad blog</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">Hello and welcome to my blog about our journey to being digital nomads, location independent or whatever the newest term is.  Whilst trying to work out how to do our lifestyle I did what you are probably doing now and research other digital nomads out there to see how they do it and I would like to thank all the other blogs out there see out links section for other sites that we used.  After deciding to take the plung and attempt this I thought it was time to give back to the community and maybe help/inspire other people to change their life (too cheesy) and do more LIFE and less WORK.

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>

        <p class="bodyText">
            We are a couple from england who have held professional jobs for most of our lives,  me in IT consultancy and becca in marketing.
            For a detailed bio of both myself and becca please check out our <a href="about.html"> about us</a> page.
        </p>
         
    <h2>Why are we doing it?</h2>

        <p class="bodyText">We have always loved travel and have done 3 big trips so feel that traveling for long periods at a time is probably been something we don’t need to do anymore.  We don't think that being full time digital nomads is right for us and are looking for that elusive balance (ahh the zen). What we are looking for is flexibility.  If we want to go away for 2 months to germany we can take our jobs with us and just do it.  Whether we make it or like it we don't know, whether we end up going back to the uk lifestyle of living in the uk permantly who knows. Follow us and keep up to date with our changing opinions/ideas.
        </p>

    <h2>What can you expect from this site?</h2>

        <p class="bodyText">I hope this site gives not just the information around where we went how we make money but all the really important (well to me anyhow) stuff like insurance and technology that makes the lifestyle possible.  This site will start by focussing on our first 3 month trial that we did to europe, how it was organised, what we took with us,  what worked, what didn't, where we go from their. 
        </p> 
        <p class="bodyText">Enjoy and contact me on twitter/facebook if you decide to take the plung like us.
