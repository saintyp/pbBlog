    <h1>Routers</h1>
    <p class="bodyText"> Whilst away i didn't want us to be totally cut off from uk tv.  To watch it as if you are in the UK you need to be able to appear on the provider (either bbc,itv,channel4) like you are
        access there services from the uk.  One of the long standing ways to do this is to VPN to uk, usually you do this to a vpn provider. However recently the bbc are being a bit millitant about people doing this
        (even though i still pay my tv licence).  To get around this you can create your own vpn endpoint in a family or friends house and use there broadband even though you are abroad.  I also wanted to make uk access as easy as possible 
        so wanted a way to connect devices like chromecast to a wifi ssid and be connected the vpn.

        Enter DD-WRT.  It takes a stock adsl router and turns it into a device that can be either a vpn endpoint(server) or a vpn client.   It then broadcasts an ssid that you attach devices to.  All those devices internet
        traffic is diverted down the VPN and it my case appearing as if its in the UK.

        I used a pair of linksys e1200 routers flashed with the x firmware and setup the system as follows.
