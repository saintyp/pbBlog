	<p class="bodyText">Yea, I have an addiction to buying travel bags, it’s a problem. First, I have a strong objection to this One Bag theory that a lot of nomads subscribe to. If you’re traveling with only one carry on backpack, you will inevitably run into a situation where some random budget airline says your bag is still too big to carry on, or some long tail boat or ferry wants to toss your bag in a pile on the deck, or a bus driver wants to tie your bag to the roof. If you’ve got everything carefully packed into one bag you have no choice but to hand it all over including your laptop, iPad, passport, and everything. I prefer to always travel with two bags and when everything is all packed up I have a small day pack with all the valuable stuff in it that never leaves my side, the bigger bag just has clothes and things that can get tossed all over and I don’t really care.
