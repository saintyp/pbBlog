    <h1> The Trial </h1>
        <h2>Where did we go and why</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">The main focus of our trial was being abe to work whilst being abroad.  To this end we decided to use airbnb.  Whilst one of the main needs of the airbnb was to have wifi having not done this before we had to take and ultra caution approach.  We knew we wanted to visit spain and portugal so I researched locations in spain and portugal that had co working spaces.  This brought the list of locations down to quite a small subset and gave us the security that if the airbnb apartment wifi was no good we could at least goto a coworking space and continue to work.
The trial was originally supposed to happy out of season (our ideal date was march-june) however due to commitments in the UK our earliest leave date was 13th june or high season in europe.  This severely limited our choice of accomadation and I suspect ramped up the costs.
In the when the two factors of limited accomadation and co working space where combined we settled on two places
    </p>
        <p class="bodyText">Fuengirola : On the costa del sol and right on the beach
        Lisbon: Living 8min on the train from the city center.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText"> We thought that the combination of both beach and city life would give us some good information after the trial as to what we liked and didn't like.
    </p>


    <h2>Co Working Spaces</h2>


    <p class="bodyText">The best information I could find coworking was on this website.

http://coworking.es

Price in fuengirola was approc 150 euro for a desk. Not great but not bad if the wifi in the airbnb failed.
