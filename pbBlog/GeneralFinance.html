    <h1> General Finance</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">Starting our journey to flexibility didn’t start with our discovery of digital nomads.  I have been trying to get us to a point of financial security for quite a few years so maybe our experience is more unique than most but that doesn't mean you cannot do it.
Before I talk about how to get there lets talk about where we are at the moment

    <h2>Where we are at the moment</h2>

        <p class="bodyText">We purchased our house 5 years ago in guildford and worked hard over those five years to pay off the mortgage.  We now own our own home which is our safety net (we may have to grow vegtables in the garden to survive but we will always have a roof over our head).
            Last year we also decided that we needed some sort of longer term investment so with that in mind we brought a buy to let flat in london which we rent out.  That investment does not really provide us with any revenue and is more a longer term investment but with changes to the tax system/brexit that may or may not pay off.
            I don't really like debt so don’t have credit card or personal loan debt (except the mortagage in london).  I am frugal with money (the wife says tight) but it has got us to the place we are today.
        </p>

<h2>How did we get there?</h2>

    <p class="bodyText">There is a great website called <a href="http//moneymoustache"> money moustache</a> which talks about how to retire within 10 years.  Whilst that is not what I tried to do with my life it does cover the concepts of paying off your mortagage  and I don't think its worth repeating all of his ideas here but I think my approach could be described as
</p>

<p class="bodyText">Don't have debt (if you can avoid it)
If you do have debt pay it off
Live frugally but still have a life
Save as much as you can
When you spend think about if you really need it and if it is good value.</p>
