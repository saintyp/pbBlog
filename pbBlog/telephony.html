    <h1>Telephony</h1>
    <p class="bodyText"> Being able to be contacted wherever we were was a vital component of what we were trying to achieve. Inorder to be available anywhere in the world we deceded to trial a VOIP number. After looking around we decided that our first trial would be with a skype number.  It cose approx £12 for 3 months and has a geograhical location of london.
        This allows any clients to call us on a uk numbers and for it to ring skype. This means that we only require phone data or wifi to recieve calls.  With skype you can also setup call forwarding so if you don't have data but do have phone signal you could ask skype to forward the call to your foreign phone number (although that forwarded call woudl be paid for
        out of your skype credit).  
        
        While in spain and as we are only on a month long trail here we took advantage of 3 at home which allows youto use you uk minutes and data in any of its three at home destinations.
        Whilst not a long term solution like the skype we are trialing it certainly is the cheapest and easiest for us in spain.  I purchased a £20 12gig data top up for my phone which worked fine.
        
        For portugal i think we are going to use the MEO holiday which is 15 euros for 15 days which you can then top up.
        
        I don't know how often we will teather our phones or use the data allowances (see updates after the trial) as compared to just being on wifi but we wanted to test a whole solution.
