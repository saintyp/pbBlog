    <h1>Laptops</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">Seeming endless choice and difficult to find reviews sometimes it is hard deciding on the machine which will provide you lively hood.  Below i will talk about what we chose and what our thoughts are on them.
        </p>
    <h2>Beccas Choice</h2>
        <p>Becca has been using a mac at her old job for the last year and really liked it so wanted one for her work machine.  Cost contrainst meant she was limited
        to the 13in macbook pro retina i5 with 256gb hard drive.
        </p>
        <p> becca review of the macbook here.</p>
        <h2>My Choice</h2>
        <p>I am much more a windows person and do love tech and had slightly higher spec requirements than my wife. I intend my machine to be able to run virtual servers and do local develpment so
        wanted something with a bit more grunt.  The macbook pro that becca purchased is over 2 years old in technology terms and although i liked it i wanted something a bit newer.  Had the new macbooks been released 
        i may have been tempted by one of those.  I also really like screen real estate so 15in screen was a minimum for me.  There are loads of choices out there and even though it had some mixed reviews i found a really 
        good deal on a dell xps 15 with i7 6500hq, 16 gig memory 256gig ssd pcie (4x faster than normal ssd) for £1000
